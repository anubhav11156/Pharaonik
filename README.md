Set of exercises designed to help you develop, learn, and refine your skills in security audits of Cairo smart contracts. The problems are inspired by real-world smart contract exploits and insights gleaned from security audit reports. By working through these exercises, you'll gain proficiency in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in Cairo contracts.

The exercises can be of three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each problem is also associated with relevant tags to guide you. These tags might indicate the specific vulnerability the exercise focuses on (e.g., reentrancy, access control, etc), the required skills (e.g., arithmetic overflows, gas optimization, etc). To ensure effective learning, each exercise follows a comprehensive format, providing background information/context, clearly defined objective, and instructions.
